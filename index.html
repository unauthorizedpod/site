As I walked outside I immediately saw an old sink lying by the tree outside my apartment. The man saw me and laughed. I crouched to peer inside the sink and saw a coin. On the coin was printed: don’t pick me up. A security guard startled me by tapping on my shoulder with a Bible in his hand. As I stood back up he opened it to Revelations and glared at me. The man across the street kept laughing, but no longer at me. Instead, he was laughing at a now-frightened mother pushing a carriage. She hurriedly crossed the street towards me and the security guard, but got hit by an oncoming bus. We all ran to help her, but saw that her face was entirely gone and the child was not a child, but a turtle which was now walking off on its own. The back of its shell read: don’t pick me up. Out of compassion, the security guard picked it up anyways and just as he did his hands became webbed and his eyes began bulging. He instinctively reacted to a fly buzzing around by snatching it out of the air with his newly formed frog tongue. He then hopped twenty feet down the street and out of sight. The turtle kept crawling away. The laughing man was deadpan now and he too walked off silently. The street became eerily quiet. Not a soul was in sight as I walked down to the coffee shop. The door was missing when I arrived and I didn’t hear a sound or see anyone inside, not even a barista. There was a small cup of freshly-made coffee on the counter though.
